Garage door open sensor, RF comms to apartment, but submarine style red light light in the apartment

Making this repository to hold myself accountable so I actually build it

Look into LoRa (like the Dragino LoRa board I read about)
Also sparkfun weather shield for monitoring the temp and humidity down there during winter

Starting with Adafruit rfm69hcw 900
25mA draw when listening
10mA when asleep
0.3mA when using sleepdog package https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SleepyDog
